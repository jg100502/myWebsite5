    <h1>Facts About Arsenal</h1>
    <p>Arsenal was founded in 1886 by a group of workers from the Woolwich Arsenal Armament Factory. Originally known as Dial Square, the club’s name was later changed to Royal Arsenal
     and eventually became Arsenal Football Club.
     The club signed the largest sponsorship deal in English football history,
     worth approximately £100 million, when they gave the naming rights to their new stadium to the airline company Emirates.</p>
